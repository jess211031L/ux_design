# Page layout

___
Our group decided to create a pet-friendly hotel. 

<img src = "main1.png" />

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src = "main2.png" /></td>
<td><img src = "main3.png" /></td>

## Purpose
Boston hotel webpage is to attract and provide information to pet owners who are looking for accommodations that allow their furry friends to stay with them. By creating a webpage that is specifically designed to highlight the pet-friendly amenities of the hotel, such as pet beds, food bowls, and nearby pet-friendly attractions, hotel owners can target a specific audience and increase their chances of getting bookings from pet owners.

Boston can be a valuable resource for travelers who are unsure of how to travel with their pets. The webpage can provide information on pet policies, such as size and breed restrictions, pet fees, and rules for pets in public areas. By providing clear information upfront, hotels can help pet owners make informed decisions about their travel plans and reduce the stress of traveling with a pet.

## Conclusion
